        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <h2> The Sad Lakers Fan</h2>
   My name is Tariq Osman. This is my first year at RCTC, and I'm a CS major. I was born in Toronto, and I moved to Rochester when I was 5. I went to Mayo High School and graduated in 2021. I'm interested in CS jobs, specifically Cyber Security. This is my first computer science course, so hopefully it goes well. Some hobbies I have are playing and watching basketball. My favorite team unfortunately is the LA Lakers.I like travelling and being outdoors. A special talent I have is I can dunk a basketball. If that's a talent I guess. My family motives me to be better. My role models are my mom and grandma. They showed me how to work hard.
